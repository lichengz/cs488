Manual:

All required features were implemented. Tested on lab machine gl38.
I assume the following:
-The initial position of the cube is at the center, with no rotation.
-Scaling ranges from 0.1 to 2.0
-The initial viewport has a 5% margin around the top, bottom, left and right edges, which means it takes over 81% (0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81) of the window area.
