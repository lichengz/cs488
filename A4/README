Compilation:
Steps:
    1. $ premake4 gmake
    2. $ make
    3. $ ./A4 sample.lua

Tested on lab machine: gl33
===============================================================================
Manual:

All required features implemented. nonhier.png, macho-cows.png, simple-cows.png and macho-cows-bb.png
can be found in the Assets/ directory. sample.lua and sample.png are placed in the A4 root directory.

Extra Feature: Mirror reflections.
I add an additional argument in the PhongMaterial, called reflectivity, which is a real number ranging from 0 to 1.
In the sample.lua file, both material lake_blue and waterball_blue have a reflectivity of 0.5.
In the A4.cpp file, the function glm::vec3 color is called recursively if the material's reflectivity is greater than 0,
with a max recursion times = 10.

Bounding Volume Code:
Uncomment #define RENDER_BOUNDING_VOLUMES in mesh.cpp to render a spherical bounding volume.

Test Scene: sample.lua
There's a lake in the center of a grass plane, surrounded by stones. A blue ball flows in the middle of air.
The blue ball has a shiny surface. Both the lake and the ball reflect lights like mirrors.
